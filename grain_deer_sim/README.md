# Grain-Deer Simulation

A C++ program developed for my parallel programming class that simulates the growth of grass based on temperature, precipitation, deer population. I added the variable, wolves that act as a predator to the deer. The program utilizes the concept of functional decomposition implementing subfunctions in parallel threads.
